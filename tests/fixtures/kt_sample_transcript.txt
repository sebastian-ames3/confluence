KT Technical Analysis - December 13, 2024

GOOGL (Alphabet) - Elliott Wave Analysis:

We had a monster breakout from the 270 low. Looking at the wave structure, we're in an intermediate degree wave 5 to the upside. Wave 4 appears to be completing with support likely holding at the 0.236 fib level around 319. If we get deeper retracement, the 0.382 fib at 313 should provide solid support. The 0.5 fib sits at 308.

Upside targets for wave 5 completion are looking at 328 to 330 zone. If we lose 310, I'd be concerned, but the real invalidation is below 270 where weekly demand breaks. That would negate the whole bullish count.

SPX (S&P 500):

The S&P is in wave 3 of an impulse structure. We're trending higher with good momentum. Key support is at 5800, and if that holds, we target 6100 for wave 3 completion. The hard invalidation is if we lose 5650 - that breaks the impulsive structure.

IWM (Russell 2000):

Russell completed wave 5 at the 252 highs. We're now in a corrective pullback - wave A is targeting the 0.382 retracement at 236. That's the demand zone I'm watching. If we get there, that's a buy zone for the next leg up. Deeper support is at 231 which is the 0.5 fib. Below 226 invalidates the bullish count and we'd need to reassess.
