    "content_text": "Stocks were muted yesterday as the end of the government shutdown had already been priced in on Monday' rip higher.  Mag 7 names were under a bit of pressure but AMD continued to keep the Semis afloat.  We have PPI tomorrow and are waiting to see the data schedule going forward and whether or not we will get the employment and inflation data that was missed.  \n\nThe bigger moves came in commodities as Oil dumped 4% on oversupply concerns and some better rhetoric out of the Russia/Ukraine conflict.  Gold and Silver had a strong rally and Silver is already back to the highs.  I was clearly a little premature unwinding my call spread earlier this week.  Vol and call skew are popping again on the move so defo feel like it has legs.  Still running very light on the commodities hedge so happy to see it.\n\nEquity vol till looks like it has some downside over the next couple of weeks but we've been whipping around enough to keep the carry quite neutral on SPX.  Intraday gamma selling hasn't been the easiest trade and I've noticed that the market tends to find stability much later in the day, but this may be fleeting and should be monitored closely.  We also haven't had as many Trump/China headlines to worry about, but thee could come back at any point.\n\nSome vol supply is to be expected next week into OPEX and dealers won't be keen to load up on decay ahead of Thanksgiving, so be careful owning too much naked optionality.",

    "content_text": "Stocks hammered yesterday as the momentum unwind picks up steam once again.  Market suddenly cares about AI valuations and these names could have a long way to fall.  Broader index not completely falling out of bed as defensive sectors and Oil names holding up for now.  Russell did take a beating though down near 3%.\n\nPrecious metals were originally bid but are now rolling over with risk assets and crypto is getting hamered. BTC below the key 98k level which opens up a lot more potential downside.  88-90k is next major support so be careful on running downside risk.  \n\nVIX has come back to life with spot hitting 22 this morning.  Futures curve has inverted once again and VVIX exploding back above 110.  The 25 strike zone has a lot of OI for next Wednesday VIX expiry so may be the target for this VIX move.  I'd be surprised if we didn't see some profit taking on calls or at least rolling out.\n\nThe charts on frothy names like quantum and speculative AI look horrendous and retail looks like they are out of firepower to buy the dip.  Need to be careful about catching the falling knife.  NVDA earnings next week have become super important to keep the AI narrative intact.  At implied move of 6.4% it looks a bit cheap to me.  Might be worth renting the straddle for 21Nov.\n\nI flipped the VIX position to short via a Nov 18 put and VXX 21Nov/28Nov put calendar.  Banked the VIX call fly.  RUT flyagonal will likely need some management today as the delta has grown on this drop.  \n\nVol spreadsheets are broken this morning hence no dashboards - so come along to the zoom call if you want to chat.",

    "content_text": "Risk assets had another rough day as there is clearly more de-risking ahead of key events this week (NVDA and NFP), likely from CTA sell triggers being activated.  Russell underperformed other indices and is showing oversold on the compass, although vol and put skew are catching a bid which is ominous.\n\nBonds were firm and the dollar was stable. Precious metals had a pullback and remain much more volatile than equities.  Other commodities were also under pressure like Uranium and Copper, however Oil was flat.\n\nVIX had a big pop to 23ish and looks like it might want to engage with the large 25 strike zone before Wednesday's expiry.  I do still think there is a reset coming next week, but it's hard to tell how high we go first.  You probably want to give yourself a few bites at the cherry if trying to fade vol.  We entered some low premium expressions last week.  Might do some more towards the end of this week.\n\nSelling intraday (0DTE) gamma has been a tough game recently.  I had spotted some stability coming back in the last couple of hour of the day last week, but that was not apparent yesterday.  I tried an noon iron fly and got stopped out quickly on the slide lower.\n\nStaying nimble is the key here.  When vol goes up, take smaller bets and don't get married to positions.  Plenty of opportunity all over the place but also high risk so stick with fixed loss expressions.\n\nCrypto markets have been leading us lower recently and they are at a key technical inflection point around 90k on BTC.  Watch that market for a tell on where risk assets might be headed.",

One encoraging sign was that Russell outperformed after trading very heavy last week.  However, defensive sectors saw clear outperformance as the market appears nervous ahead of NFP later this week.  \n\nBonds and the dollar continue to tread water but commodities had a nice bounce led by Silver which is higher again overnight.  Precious metals are holding very well vs stocks and crypto once again and this speaks to the physical supply deficit.\n\nVIX tagged 25 before this mornings expiry and looks to be indicating around 24 with the overnight bounce in SPX.  Defo feels like a VIX fading opportunity in the making but obviously depends on the market playing ball and finding some support.  I do think hedge funds have been piling on some shorts recently so their is squeeze potential, it just needs a spark to kick it off.  \n\nMy original target of 7000 by Thanksgiving looks very unlikely, but that's why we chose a low premium structure like a call fly so we can get some more attempts.  I also picked up those bullish structure highlighted yeterday in NVDA and TLSA.  Looking to unwind the RUT flyagonal this morning a it seems to have done its job in earning us some THETA.",

The 21Nov expiry repriced the most at it contains NVDA earnings but also now captures jobs data which is due to be released on Thursday.  With OPEX this week, we should start to see some vol supply and with Thanksgiving on 27th Nov the front of the curve should get hammered into the weekend.  The AI theme has been under some pressure lately so NVDA earnings will likely be a major risk event for broader market sentiment.  \n\nThe daily straddle is worth around 40 ticks today and the overnight has already achieved that.  I observed that the only \"safe\" time sell intraday gamma was late in the session from 2pm-3.30pm where the market had already had it's major move and found some stability.  Running short into the close is still a bit of a risk which I personally don't like.",
